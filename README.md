# What is a workfile
Workfile is a project specification file with extension __.work__. 

It is a Markdown compatible text file, that contains an overall project milestones including assignments, priorities, deadlines, tasks etc in a single text file. 

## Inspiration
There are several project management tools available today. Each one has its pros and cons. A varying range of such tools exist because we have our own preferences. Workfile doesn't claim the best way to manage a project, but it definitely provides a different approach to project definition - better call it a "Common Instinct" approach.

## So much of Common Sense ?
__We go on a shopping with a shopping list.__ Workfile starts with something as simple as a text file where you simply remember and list down the things you want to do.
__Workfile__ is inspired by that instinct.
